Animation clips in this folder are duplicates from the ones in the man and woman folder, which have been downloaded from Mixamo.

Animations must use the avatar that belongs to the model on which it will be applied to.

When downloading from Mixamo, it is recommended to select the default character include the skin. 

In order to save space, animations can be downloaded from Mixamo without a skin.
However in order to avoid playback erros, these animations must be configured to use the avatar of a Mixamo character, which is why the Default Mixamo character is included in this project.
